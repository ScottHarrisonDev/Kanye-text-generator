I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight What does it feel like, I ask you tonight To live a real life I just wanna be a real boy They always say \"Kanye, he keeps it real boy\" Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy It's funny Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it I tell the truth, and I keep running It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel Do you really have the stamina? For everybody that sees you that say, \"Where's my camera?\" For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh You oughta laugh!? I just wanna be a real boy Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy Pinocchio's story goes And there is no Gepetto, to guide me No one, right beside me The only one, was behind me I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more I can't.. The only one that come out on the tour and stays Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream And the fame will be get got And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death Thinkin' the money that the- You spend the dough to death And tell me what be left, for a real boy! They say \"Kanye, you keep it too real boy\" Perspective, and wise man say One day, you'll find your way The wise man say, you'll find your way The wise man say, you'll find your way Wise man say"
