I'ma rock the boat, work the middle 'til it hurt a little Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time Back in the lab and shit My wife said, I can't say no to nobody And at this rate we gon' both die broke Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt And like my wife said, I still didn't say no People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter My friends' best advice was to stay low I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills Especially when you got family members on payroll The media said it was outlandish spendin' The media said he's way out of control I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin' I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control I know I'm the most influential That TIME cover was just confirmation This generation's closest thing to Einstein So don't worry about me, I'm fine I can see a thousand years from now in real life Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like Troll conventional thought, don't need to question I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission Did it with no permission, on our own conditions Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission Yeezy with the big house, did it way different Never listen to Hollywood producers Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa The ultimate Gemini has survived I wasn't supposed to make it past 25 I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation He sat back and smiled Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout \"how my neck look?\" Well... it all looks great Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard Real family stick together and see through the mirage The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary? I am one with the people I am one with the people I've been woken from enlightened man's dream Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem Let me not say too much or do too much Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin' God, I have humbled myself before the court Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go We all go Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow"
